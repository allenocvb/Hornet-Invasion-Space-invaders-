Hornet Invasion

Hornet Invasion is a clone of the popular arcade game; Space Invaders. I created this game by following the "Python Crash Course" book. The reason was to improve my python skills.

Space Invaders is a space shooter game where players control a ship at the screen's bottom. Using arrow keys to move and spacebar to fire, players must destroy descending alien fleets. Each cleared fleet is replaced by a faster one. The game ends if aliens collide with the player's ship, reach the bottom, or destroy the player's three lives.

Requirements:
Python 3
Pygame

Controls:
Space-bar : Shoot
Arrow-Keys(Right and left): moves Exterminator

Getting Started:
