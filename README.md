# Hornet Invasion

Hornet Invasion is a clone of the popular arcade game, Space Invaders. I created this game by following the "Python Crash Course" book to improve my Python skills.

Hornet Invasion is a space shooter game where players control a ship at the screen's bottom. Using arrow keys to move and spacebar to fire, players must destroy descending alien fleets. Each cleared fleet is replaced by a faster one. The game ends if aliens collide with the player's ship, reach the bottom, or destroy the player's three lives.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pygame

## Controls

- Space-bar: Shoot
- Arrow-Keys (Right and Left): Moves Exterminator
